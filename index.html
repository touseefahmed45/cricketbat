    The first and original of the Spartan colored bat range Gold Boss bat was first used by Chris Gayle in BBL05. It exploded onto the scene, turning heads and took the excitement of Twenty20 cricket to another level. The Gold bat is a world-wide phenomenon, with Spartan allowing you to own your very own piece of BOSS bling.</p>
